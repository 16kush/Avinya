# AVINYA

Avinya is an innovative peer-to-peer (P2P) learning platform designed to revolutionize the way knowledge is shared and acquired. It provides a collaborative environment where learners become both teachers and students, fostering a dynamic and interactive learning experience for all participants. 

## Getting Started

Clone the repo to your local environment, you have to separately install all the dependencies for backend and frontend.

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend folder: `cd Backend`.
2. Install the required dependencies by running: `npm i`.

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend folder: `cd Fronttend`.
2. Install the required dependencies by running: `npm i`

### MongoDB Installation
- Install [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/).
- Alternatively, you can use the [website](https://account.mongodb.com/account/login) to set up MongoDB.

### Environmental Variables
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the backend folder.
2. Add your tokens and credentials as environmental variables in the `.env` file, following the configuration file's variables.
3. Here are the required variables you should set in the `.env` file:


### Note
Make sure the `.env` file's variables match with those in the configuration files. Refer to the image below for reference:

##### Backend
```
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET =
ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFE =
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET =
REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFE =
SENDGRID_KEY =
MONGO_DATABASE =
AUTH_GOOGLE =
STRIPE_SECRET_TOKEN =
REDIS_HOST =
REDIS_PASSWORD =
REDIS_PORT =
NODE_ENV = 'development' 
```

##### Frontend

```
REACT_APP_STRIPE_API_KEY = 
PUBLIC_URL = 
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY = 
NODE_ENV = 

```


### Development Environment
To run the development environment, you need to start the backend and frontend separately.

#### Backend
Run the following command in the backend folder: `npm start`. This will start the nodemon-watched API server on port 8080.

#### Frontend
Run the following command in the frontend folder: `npm start`. This will start the development web server on port 3000 for the frontend.

Note: Remember to run `npm start` separately for both the backend and frontend.

With these steps completed, you should have the Avinya educational platform up and running on your local environment. Happy coding!
